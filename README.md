# InlineSqlSharp
InlineSqlSharp is a type-safe SQL query builder for C#. It allows developers to construct SQL statements using familiar SQL-like APIs directly within their code.

**Note:** This library requires Dapper for bind parameters and SQL execution. Ensure you have Dapper installed and configured in your project to use InlineSqlSharp.
