# SqlArtisan
SqlArtisan is a C# library for building SQL queries. It features a straightforward interface, intentionally designed to mimic SQL syntax closely. Ideal for developers who prefer writing SQL directly, this library serves as a clear alternative to the fluent and more abstract interfaces found elsewhere.

**Note:** This library requires Dapper for bind parameters and SQL execution. Ensure you have Dapper installed and configured in your project to use InlineSqlSharp.
