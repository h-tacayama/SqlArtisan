# ADR 0005 — Public API location

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The public surface is the library's contract: it must be discoverable and clearly
separated from internals that are free to change.

## Decision

- The public API is one **`public static partial class Sql`**, split across
  `src/SqlArtisan/Sql/Sql.{A..W}.cs` — one file per leading letter of the function
  name.
- The remaining public surface lives under `src/SqlArtisan/SqlBuilder/`.
- A narrow set of **public table-reference types** lives under
  `src/SqlArtisan/SqlPart/TableReference/` — the types consumers subclass or
  instantiate to name relations and reference columns: `DbTableBase` / `DbTable`,
  `CteBase` / `Cte`, `DerivedTableBase` / `DerivedTable` — and the `DbColumn` they
  expose lives beside them under `src/SqlArtisan/SqlPart/Expression/`. These are
  public by necessity and part of the contract. *(Erratum 2026-07: `DbColumn`'s
  path corrected; the decision itself is unchanged.)*
- The types application code must **name** in a declaration position — a
  helper method's return type, an accumulator variable, a `List<>` element, a
  shared `static readonly` field — are public by the same necessity:
  `SqlExpression`, `SqlCondition`, `ISubquery`, `TableReference`, `SortOrder`,
  `ExpressionAlias`, `CommonTableExpression`, `DbSequence`, `SqlHints`, and
  `LockBehaviorBase`. The boundary rule: **values, items, and handles leave
  `Internal` when a mainstream flow must write their name and no
  root-namespace alternative exists; clause syntax stays** — clause fragments
  (`OrderByClause`, `PartitionByClause`, `OfClause`, `SeparatorClause`, …)
  are specified through the builder chain at the call site, and the natural
  unit of reuse is the completed expression, which the roots already name.
  Every concrete node under the roots (`AndCondition`, `LikeCondition`,
  `CountFunction`, …) stays in `Internal/` and is held only through them;
  pure-mechanism bases with no user-facing members (`SqlPart`) stay too.
  *(Moved from `Internal` to the root namespace, #244.)*
- **Everything under `Internal/` is implementation detail**, even where a type is
  `public` for technical reasons.

## Consequences

- Discoverable: `Sql.` surfaces the whole function API, in small per-letter files.
- Internals refactor freely without breaking consumers.
